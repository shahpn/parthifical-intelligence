Assistant name: Param

Objective: We built PARAM with the goal of creating a modular AI. 
Our initial project was to create a small scale chatbot to assist students on our campus with frequently asked questions, course information, and campus history.

Currently we are developing a modular system to be able to retrain PARAM easily on any kind of data, to have it be specialized in any specific topic.

The most charming (and suave) AI assistant you'll ever have the pleasure of meeting :)
